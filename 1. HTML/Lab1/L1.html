	<h1>What is HTML ?</h1>
	<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the web. It provides the basic structure of a webpage, allowing you to organize content, add text, images, links, and multimedia. HTML uses a system of elements and tags (like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, etc.) to define how content should be displayed in a web browser. 
		While HTML handles the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is often used alongside it to control the layout and visual appearance, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Together, these technologies form the backbone of web development.</p>
